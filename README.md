I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.jku.at/en">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>.

Due to my studies, interships and personal interest, I have gained experience with Python, especially with Panda, NumPy, Sk-learn and Matplotlib.

In my freetime, I'm currently learning a bit of web development(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) since my goal is to create a personal website :)
